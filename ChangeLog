	* Released as fickle version 2.04.

	* Reworded parts of README; included explanation of change to
	[unput].	

	* Changes some internal variable names.  With the exception of
	yy_scan_string, all other global variables beginning with 'yy_'
	are used to keep track of internal fickle states.  (Of course,
	this is all changed if %option prefix is given.)

	* Fixed a missing parameter within yyless function.  Thanks to Jon
	Harrison for reporting this.
